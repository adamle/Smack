# Smack - iOS app for mini-forum

## About me

As a UI/UX designer, I always want to know more about coding and gain more understanding about my developers' challenges. Thus I decided to take a course in learning Swift with  [**Devslopes**](https://devslopes.com/). Smack is a Slack-like app that I learnt to build in **Devslopes** course. It is the very first application that really really challenging for me. I have to learn and execute a ton of developing skills and knowledges that so new and difficult to me like how to create a local database, how to make a Heroku cloud, or how to use Postman for APIs. Before **Devslopes Swift course**, I used to learn coding only by finishing lessons about syntax. The most advanced lessons for me was the [**Standard ML course in Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) which improved my logical thinking a lot! (*Looping and Recursion are no longer my nightmare* üëª) However, when I came to build this Smack app, the real challenge is not only about Swift syntax, but also about the whole process and skill of building a real beautiful UI and workable-like-a-charm mobile application. It took me a month, full time, of building Smack. ***But it worths every single moment***. And here is some more detail description of Smack üòé

## What I learnt

Building Smack I am able to learn a great deal of technical knowledge. Besides native Swift knowledge such as managing XIB file, or programming standard like MVC, I also learnt how to handle:

 1. Pods integration with CocoaPod
 2. Alamofire for API calling and getting
 3. Socket.io for exchanging messages
 4. SwiftJSON for handling json file in Swift in a neat way

## App Main Features

In this section, I will provide detailed information about what Smack as an iOS app can do.

## Conclusion

Smack is totally worth my huge effort to build and to learn. After a month of coding Smack, I felt more confident and determined on the journey of learning iOS app development.
